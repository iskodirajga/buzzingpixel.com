  Would you like to hire me to work on a project? Build an add-on? Consult on the best way to get something done? Let’s chat. I’ve got a lot to bring to the table. I have 10 years of experience with web development and in particular, ExpressionEngine. I know how to get things done, and I love delighting clients and paying attention to the details.

  If that sounds like something you’re interested in, fill out the form over there and submit it, and we’ll get the conversation started!

## Working with me

I love delighting my clients so when you start the conversation with me, the first thing we’ll do is figure out the project scope. Then, when we're ready to pull the trigger, I’ll block off the entire amount of time defined by the project scope. That means that when the project starts, my work time is dedicated to you. I’ve found that this is the best possible way to delight clients and it works out the best for me because I can focus on the job at hand and pay attention to the details.

## Rates and Scope

Many folks will often ask me for my hourly rate, but one of my goals is to change that conversation. Hourly estimates are very difficult to do and it encourages micro-management of a project rather than focusing on scope and getting it done.

So I estimate most projects by weeks. Break things down into increments and figure the amount of weeks that will take. Then, for every three weeks, we add an additional week to the calendar (because I'm sure we all know how the best laid plans of men and mice go).

If the project is small enough, I will estimate in terms of days as well, but I really love dedicated weeks on a single project at a time.

## Let's work together

The result is always delight in the work for both me and you. So let's get the conversation started. Fill out the form above and I’ll get in touch with you!
