MobileText: Mobile devices are more prevelant than ever before and these users need for the sites they visit to not just work, but be usable and look good from whatever devices they are using whether that be an iPhone, an Android phone, an iPad or any other tablet device, or their laptop or desktop computer. They don't want a subset of functionality or usability on some devices. It's a non-starter to tell users they have to use a different device to access all the functionality of the site. Developing sites mobile first has never been more important.</p><p>With this new site build, every feature was designed and developed with all screen sizes in mind â€” from search and playground filtering, to learning more about safety features and getting a quote on a playground.</p><p>On the new PlayAndPark.com, we made sure that users of all screen sizes would feel right at home. Use whatever device is available to you and your experience will be great not matter what.
