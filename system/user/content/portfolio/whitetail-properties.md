Description: During my time as senior developer at Caddis Interactive, I had the privileged of being lead developer on this project. When it came time to rebuild the WhitetailProperties website and bring it up to the latest web standards for usability, making a mobile friendly site was key. The new site is fully responsive for all screen sizes and devices of any kind.

## Dynamic search

One of the primary objectives in rebuilding the Whitetail Properties website was to make it easier for users of the site to find the properties they wanted. Meeting this objective started on the home page where you can click on any state to be taken to a listing of properties in that state. And you can further filter by county, price, acreage and more when you get to that page.

The interactive map makes it very easy to pinpoint where properties are located, what county and state they are in and more. All the interaction happens dynamically as users select options and it's all a completely custom experience.

## Save Searches, Favorite Properties, Get Notifications

Another major new feature was user accounts that allows users to save their favorite properties and searches and get emails when they have been updated or push notifications to the Whitetail app. I build a completely custom solution using ExpressionEngine's native user registration as the backbone and a lot of custom PHP and add-ons for ExpressionEngine to get the job done. The result is a great experience.
