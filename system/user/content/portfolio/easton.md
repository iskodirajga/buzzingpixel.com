## Mobile Friendly

In a world where everyone has a hand-held device that connects to the Internet, responsive websites have never been more important. That's why EastonHunting.com needed their website to be responsive to all devices sizes.

## The Show Case

The showcase on the home page makes a great entry point into the site, making it easy for users to see the latest and what's new.

## Multi-Dimensional Products

Many of the products lines available through the online store needed to have the capability of multiple configurations and dimensions — weight, color, size, and so on. And each variations of product needed to have its own sku and stock. With some custom add-ons, I was able to provide this for them.

## Engaging Blog

When it came to the blog listings, we wanted something more eye catching than the standard fair. Each blog entry has a rich graphic associated with it so that readers can be immediately immersed and understand a little something about the article they are about to click on.
