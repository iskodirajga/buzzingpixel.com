      For more than 10 years I have crafted great website experiences that delight users and businesses. I’ve built websites such as:

      - [Whitetail Properties](https://www.whitetailproperties.com/)
      - [Play and Park](https://www.playandpark.com/)
      - [Easton Hunting](http://www.eastonhunting.com/)

      I love delighting people, reveling in the details, and getting the little things right. I also work with great designers to achieve the perfect look and feel for your unique brand and needs.

      Every detail counts, every line of code matters. I don’t just cobble a bunch of plugins or themes together, I write every line of HTML and CSS for every site I build. The result is a site that is of the highest caliber and highly performant. You won’t have to worry about Google ranking you lower in search results because of site speed issues, and you won't have to worry about a great end-to-end mobile-to-desktop experience. All BuzzingPixel sites are built responsive first. That means they look great on any screen you can put it on.

      Revel in the details, delight clients. That's my web development motto.

      If you have an existing team and need me to step in and help — or maybe you’re a fellow developer and don’t have the time to get it all done — I work well with others. I’m fully supportive of Git version control best practices and how to leverage that in a team environment. And I’m a big advocate of Git-flow

      I’ve had the privilege of both mentoring, being mentored, and just working with my peers and I love teaming up with great people.

      So if you need help, don't be afraid, I can definitely help!
