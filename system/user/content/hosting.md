      Boy do I have experience. I’ve worked with nearly every type of hosting environment there is — and believe me, much of the hosting scene out there is, how can we put this? **not good**.
      
      But over the years, I’ve gained the experience and developed the right tools, and know the right steps to create a great hosting experience for your ExpressionEngine, Craft, or Wordpress based website. No more shared hosting, no more slow response times, no more hassle. When you work with me for your hosting, you get dedicated resources, automated deployments, nightly backups, and more!

      My goal in anything I’ve ever done has always been to create the best experience I can for anyone I’m working with. And because of my experience with hosting (both good and bad), this is another area I can leverage to bring joy into your life. When you work with me to provide a hosting solution, the quality of experience will be second to none.
