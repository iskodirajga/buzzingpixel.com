BuzzingPixel is the work of one developer, and that’s me, TJ Draper. This is where you’ll find my various projects, ExpressionEngine add-ons, and the like.

I enjoy writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to make beautiful, responsive websites. I also enjoy crafting great content management experiences and writing great add-ons for great CMSes that make content management better. In short, I enjoy building websites and delighting clients, and you can hire me! Use the [contact form to get in touch](/contact)!

When I’m not developing software, I’m probably spending time with my 4 children and/or my beautiful wife, watching a movie or TV show, or podcasting.
