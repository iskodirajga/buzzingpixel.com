Title: Updating from ExpressionEngine 2 to 3
---

Category Construct has changed from a module to a plugin for ExpressionEngine 3. That’s because ExpressionEngine 3 has it’s own drag and drop category management interface so Category Construct no longer needs to include that functionality. Category Construct is now purely about the tags. As such, and since Category Construct has no settings, I recommend uninstalling Category Construct altogether before updating from ExpressionEngine 2 to 3. You can install the new version after you have updated.
