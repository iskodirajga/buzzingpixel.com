Title: Display Fields
---

Use these toggles to control Title, Caption, and Cover fields. Title and Caption are input fields that will made available to each image in the field, and the Cover field allows the user to select one of the uploaded images as the cover. You can control the output of cover fields with the template tags â€” like whether the cover should appear first, or only display the cover, or skip the cover, etc.
