Title: Configuring Less
---

Fabricatorâ€™s Less build process includes a number of variables you can override to control every aspect of your site. And you can also define custom variables.

To define your own variables or override core variables, create a Less file or multiple Less files in `assetsSource/css/config/variables` to put your variables in.

To override any core variables, copy the relevant variable into your variables file and change the value.
