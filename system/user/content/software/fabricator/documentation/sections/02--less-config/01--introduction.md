Title: Configuring Less
---

Fabricators Less build process includes a number of variables you can override to control every aspect of your site. And you can also define custom variables. You will define all variables — whether defining your own to be made available globally, or overriding default variables — in `assetsSource/css/config/variables.less`.

To override any core variables, copy the relevant variable into your variables file and change the value.
