Construct 2's settings have been slimmed down a little from the Construct 1 days. That is mostly due to the fact that Template Preferences have been moved to their own section of the control panel. You will now find two settings in the settings area.

## Enable Routing

Construct serves two purposes:

1. A powerful drag and drop menu creation system
2. Create page endpoints

The Enable Routing toggle determines whether the second of those purposes is being used or not. If you would like to only use Construct to create menus, you can disable routing. This will also hide all page creation options when creating or editing nodes (items in the menus).

## License Key

This is where you enter the license key from your purchase of Construct via devot:ee. If you have not entered a license key, Construct will display a friendly reminder to do so throughout it's control panel pages.

<div class="content-blocks__note">
	<div class="content-blocks__note-title">Remember</div>
	<p>You need to purchase one license for each public install of ExpressionEngine you use Construct with (you do not need additional licenses for local dev and staging sites behind passwords).</p>
</div>
