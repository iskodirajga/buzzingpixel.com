    text: <p>For all of ExpressionEngine’s flexibility and powerful content management, there has not traditionally been a good way to manage stand-alone pages or create flexible menu systems that developers and content managers alike can both use with ease. Construct solves both of these problems.</p><p>Each Construct node has the option of both routing to a template, and outputting a menu structure in template tags.</p><p>Construct can also have multiple trees to fit many different content, page, and menu scenarios. But Construct doesn’t stop there.</p>

    text: <p>Construct’s flexible settings allow you to use it strictly for building menus, defining what member groups have access to various trees, and more.</p><p>And Construct’s master template preferences allow developers to associate ExpressionEngine templates with specific channels so that you can be sure the template chosen will fit the entry fields.</p><p>The template preferences also serve the purpose of giving your templates friendlier names so your users won’t be confused and so you can use ExpressionEngine’s “hidden templates” feature.</p>

    text: <h2 class="software-page__content-heading">Powerful Template Tags</h2><p>Construct’s template tags make no assumptions. In true ExpressionEngine style, Construct is purely BYOM (bring your own markup). You determine what your site looks like, not Construct.</p><p>The <code>{construct:children}</code> tag ensures that your nested nodes will be placed exactly where they should be.</p><p>Construct puts the power in your hands.</p>
