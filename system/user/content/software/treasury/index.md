    text: <p>If you need to store files on a CDN such as Amazon S3, or other SFTP/FTP capable location in ExpressionEngine 3, Treasury is the solution you need!</p><p>Treasury makes setting up your file locations easy. Use any Amazon S3 bucket, use private key authentication for SFTP &mdash; whether it&rsquo;s a key on your server, or a specific key to your location, or use standard FTP.<p>And if you need to combine Treasury&rsquo;s file storage engine with the power of <a href="/software/ansel-ee">Ansel</a>, you can do that too! Ansel is fully compatible with Treasury. In fact, with Treasury API, any developer can make their applicable add-on Treasury aware.</p>
