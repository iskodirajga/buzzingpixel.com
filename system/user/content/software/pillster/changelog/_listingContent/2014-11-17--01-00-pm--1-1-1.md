Version: 1.1.1

This release fixes a bug where multi-word statuses were not accounted for and so clicking a pill button for a multi-word status would not actually select the status. And a multi-word status would also not use the text color assigned to it if using that option.

I also took the opportunity to increase the efficiency of the Javascript by eliminating a DOM traversal for every click.
