---

Installing Marksmin is pretty easy. Use one of the guides below depending on your ExpressionEngine version.

### ExpressionEngine 2

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases] page and unzip the download
2. Copy `system/user/addons/marksmin` to your `third_party` addons system directory
  - If you are updating, replace the existing `marksmin` directory
3. Log in to your ExpressionEngine control panel and navigate to Add-Ons > Extensions
4. If you are installing Marksmin, locate 'marksmin' in the list and click install — if you are updating Marksmin, there is nothing further to do.

That’s it. Marksmin for ExpressionEngine 2 is now ready to go.

### ExpressionEngine 3

1. Download the latest release from the [GitHub Releases] page and unzip the download
2. 2. Copy `system/user/addons/marksmin` to the same directory location in your EE instance
  - If you are updating, replace the existing `marksmin` directory
3. Log in to your ExpressionEngine control panel and navigate to the Add-on Manager
4. In the Third Party Add-Ons section, locate Marksmin in the list and click Install or Update

That’s it. Marksmin for ExpressionEngine 3 is now ready to go.
