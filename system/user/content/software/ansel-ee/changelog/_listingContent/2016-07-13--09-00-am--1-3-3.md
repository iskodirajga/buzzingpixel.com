  Fixed:
    - Fixed a very rare issue where Ansel would fail to get and cache a file if the server port is required in the URL
    - Fixed an issue where Ansel might not be able to cache remote files if there are spaces in the file name
    - Fixed a bug where the ee filepicker would not use the correct upload directory if more than one Ansel field is present on the publish page (EE 2)
    - Fixed a potential bug where a Resize operation might throw errors if the cache operation failed
    - Fixed a bug where Ansel may not be able to get and cache a copy of a remote Treasury file to perform image manipulations on it

    Please note that if you are using Ansel with Treasury, this version of Ansel requires the (also just released) Treasury 1.0.2.
