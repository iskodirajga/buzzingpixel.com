## Enhancement

- Instructions on how to use the Upload/Save directory field settings will now be shown above those settings when creating/editing an Ansel field. You can disable this in Ansel settings or with the config override (`$config['ansel']['hide_source_save_instructions'] = true;`).

## Fixed

- Fixed a bug where the `{img:tag}` and `{img:url:resize}` tag variables could cause PHP warnings if no tag parameters provided
- Fixed a bug where images with spaces in the file names would not be properly URL encoded
- Fixed a bug in EE 2 where there was too much space between the label and the explanation on the Ansel settings page
