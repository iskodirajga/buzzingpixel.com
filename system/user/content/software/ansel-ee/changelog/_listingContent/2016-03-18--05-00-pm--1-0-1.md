  Fixed:
    - Fixed a bug where clicking anywhere after cropping an image resulted in angry console error
    - Fixed a bug where modal dialogs (such as for an image too small for the field settings) where shy and would not display (the modal dialog is seeing a counselor about this issue) (EE 3)
    - Fixed a bug where PNG images with transparency would become decidedly less transparent
    - Fixed an image resize calculation bug that *could* happen under the right conditions
    - Fixed a bug where Ansel may load the image for cropping from cache if you had uploaded a new image with the exact same file path
