  Enhancement:
    - Optimized query efficiency when querying for multiple files from multiple rows
  Fixed:
    - Fixed a bug where Ansel fields could not be saved, added, or updated in EE 2
    - Fixed a PHP error that would occur in PHP versions less than 5.6 when saving an Ansel field
    - Fixed a PHP warning that would occur if there was an error parsing the update feed on the Ansel updates page in the Control Panel
    - Fixed a bug where Ansel would try to delete directories it should not try to delete when deleting an Ansel image row from a field
    - Fixed a bug where under certain circumstances, Ansel would fail to create the cache directories it needs
    - Fixed a bug where EE might throw an error trying to delete a file not actually on disk (for realz this time, yo)
    - Fixed an out of memory error that could occur when trying to increase the memory limit for working with large images (the opposite affect of what was intended)
PostLog: PLEASE NOTE: Ansel used to try to compensate for limited memory situations in PHP settings (from a technical standpoint it was trying to do an `ini_set` call to increase the memory limit), but after consulting with some developers I trust, I feel doing this is a mistake and certainly was causing problems in as many cases as it was solving them. The bottom line is, I no longer feel it is appropriate to try to muck with the memory PHP has been assigned. That's a sys-ops decision and the memory available to PHP is set for a reason. If you run into memory errors saving large images (or any size image, really), you need to configure PHP to allow it more memory.
