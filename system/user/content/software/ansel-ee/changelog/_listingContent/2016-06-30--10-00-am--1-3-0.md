Version: 1.3.0
DownloadUrl: https://devot-ee.com/add-ons/ansel
Log:
  New:
    - Added support for Treasury file manager. Treasury is a new file manager by BuzingPixel that primarily provides Amazon S3 support for ExpressionEngine 3.
  Enhancement:
    - Under-the-hood improvements and code optimizations
    - Memory usage optimizations
  Fixed:
    - Fixed an issue where Ansel might interfere with PHP's configured memory settings
  Removed:
    - The `Image cache location` and `Image cache url` settings have been removed. Ansel now stores image manipulations in the save directory of the source image. This change was necessary to accommodate files in a non-local location and have on-the-fly manipulations also stored in the same location. You may want to remove the old `_ansel_image_cache` directory and the cached files in it.
