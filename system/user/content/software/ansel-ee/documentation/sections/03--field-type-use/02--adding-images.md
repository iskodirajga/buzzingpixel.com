Title: Adding Images

![Add Row](/assets/img/documentation/ansel/add-row.png)

Much like grid, when you see an Ansel field in the publish layout, it will prompt you to add images. If you have defined a minimum number of rows, those rows will already be present in the field. If not, add a row to get started.

To start the image capture process, click the "Add an image" button.

![Add an image](/assets/img/documentation/ansel/add-an-image.png)

This will bring up the file picker dialog, showing you existing images from the field setting's specified upload directory. If a suitable image is not already in this directory, you can upload one.

![Ansel Upload Directory](/assets/img/documentation/ansel/ansel-upload-dir.png)

After you select or upload an image, the image will be shown to you with a crop lasso and approve or cancel action buttons below the image.

![Ansel Cropping](/assets/img/documentation/ansel/ansel-cropping.png)

Use the crop lasso to select the relevant portion of the image you would like, and press the accept button (green check-mark).

<div class="content-blocks__note">
	<div class="content-blocks__note-title">Note</div>
	<p>You can also press enter to accept the crop or escape the cancel.</p>
</div>

Once you have done this, the thumbnail of the cropped image will appear in the image row.

If you wish to crop the image some more, click the edit icon over the image thumbnail (EE 3). Or click on the thumbnail (EE 2). To delete the image and select a different one, click the delete icon over the image and click the "Add an image" button.
