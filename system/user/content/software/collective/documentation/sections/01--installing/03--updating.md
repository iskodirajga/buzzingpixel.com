Title: Updating
---

Updating Collective is just as easy and looks a lot like the installation instructions.

1. Unzip the Collective zip file you downloaded from Devot:ee.
2. Replace the “collective” directory in `system/user/addons/collective` with the new version from your unzipped file
3. Replace the “collective” directory in your `themes/user/collective` with the new version from your unzipped file
4. Now log in to your ExpressionEngine control panel and navigate to the Add-on Manager
5. In the Third Party Add-On section, location “Collective” in the list and click the update button

That’s it. Collective is now updated to the latest version.
