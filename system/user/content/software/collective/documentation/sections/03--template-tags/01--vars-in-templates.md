Using Collective variables in your templates is pretty simple. All variables are early parsed and are available as `{collective:var_name}`. Note the namespace of `collective`. This keeps you from running into any conflicts. With the namespace, you know you are always getting a Collective variable and not something else specific to a channel entries loop or something like that.
