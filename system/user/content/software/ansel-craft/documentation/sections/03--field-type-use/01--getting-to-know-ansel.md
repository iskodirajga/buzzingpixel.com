Title: Getting to know Ansel
---

Ansel tries to make users feel right at home in the publishing work-flow and experience. When you look at an Ansel field it is going to look very familiar to you. That's because it builds on the basic styles of the Craft Table field. It's a metaphor your users should already understand. Each row in an Ansel field is an image. If a row is present in the field, an image will be required for that row. If you have allowed more than one image in a field, images can be reordered by drag and drop.

**(Ignore the ExpressionEngine screenshots for now. They will be replaced with Craft screen shots)**
