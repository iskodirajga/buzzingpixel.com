Title: Retina Mode
---

When enabled, the dimensions you enter for min/max width/height in the field settings will all be doubled behind the scenes. This allows you to set dimensions based on how you would think or normally specify dimensions in CSS, but doubles those dimensions for field requirements so that your images will be retina ready.
