Title: Manual Update
---

Updating manually (without DevDemon Updater) is also fairly simple and looks a lot like the process above.

1. Unzip the Pillster zip file you downloaded from GitHub.
2 .Replace the “pillster” directory in your third party system directory with the new version in your unzipped file from `system/expressionengine/third_party/construct`
3. Now log in to your ExpressionEngine control panel and navigate to “Add-Ons > Extensions.”

That’s it. ExpressionEngine automatically runs update routines for Extensions when you visit the Extensions page. Pillster is now updated to the latest version.
