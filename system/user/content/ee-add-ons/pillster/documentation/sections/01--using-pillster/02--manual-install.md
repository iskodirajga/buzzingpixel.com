Title: Manual Install
---

If you do not have DevDemon Updater, not to worry, it’s still pretty simple to install.

1. Unzip the Pillster zip file you downloaded from GitHub.
2. Copy `system/expressionengine/third_party/pillster` to your third party system directory.
3. Now log in to your ExpressionEngine control panel and navigate to “Add-Ons > Extensions.”
4. Locate “Pillster” in the list and click “Install” in the far right column.

That’s it. Pillster is installed.
