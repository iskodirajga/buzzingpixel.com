    text: <h2>A Note about ExpressionEngine 3 Compatibility</h2><p>I started work on converting this add-on for ExpressionEngine 3 but discovered that the extension hook this add-on relies on is not available (yet?) in EE 3. I do think this add-on has applicability in EE 3 because the statuses are still in a drop-down menu and there are almost never more than 2 or 3 statuses. I feel like buttons are a better experience. There is talk of adding back the hook or some form of it that would make this add-on possible. When it becomes available I anticipate porting this add-on.</p>

    text: <p>Turn the ExpressionEngine status dropdown into pill buttons for a more friendly user experience.</p><p>If, like me, you are tired of clicking multiple times to get the status set right when publishing an ExpressionEngine entry and you just want to see the status you want, aim your mouse at it and just click once, then this add-on is for you. It’s super easy to install and will work on all your channel entries.</p>
