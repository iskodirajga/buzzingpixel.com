Installing and updating Category Construct is very easy.

1. Unzip the Category Construct zip file you downloaded from devot:ee
2. Copy `system/user/addons/category_construct` to the same directory location in your EE instance
	- If you are updating, replace the existing `category_construct` directory
3. Now log in to your ExpressionEngine control panel and navigate to the Add-on Manager
4. In the Third Party Add-Ons section, locate “Category Construct” in the list and click Install or Update

That’s it. Category Construct is installed.
