Title: System Requirements
---

- ExpressionEngine 3.0.0 or greater
	- For a limited time, the Category Construct download also comes with the legacy version that supports ExpressionEngine 2.x (2.9.0)
- PHP 5.3.10 or greater
	Category Construct should support the same versions of PHP that ExpressionEngine supports (currently 5.3.10), though it is very difficult to test every version of PHP
