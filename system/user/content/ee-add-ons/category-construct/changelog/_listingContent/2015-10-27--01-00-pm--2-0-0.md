Version: 2.0.0
---

This version completely removes support for ExpressionEngine 2. For a limited time, the previous version for EE 2 is available in the zip file when you download. Because the control panel component is no longer necesary in EE 3 and Category Construct is only about the tags now, the add-on type has changed from Module to Plugin. When updating from EE 2 to 3, it is recommended that you uninstall the EE 2 version, update ExpressionEngine, then install the new version of Category Construct.
