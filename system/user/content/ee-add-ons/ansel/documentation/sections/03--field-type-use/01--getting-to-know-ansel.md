Title: Getting to know Ansel
---

Ansel tries to make users feel right at home in the publishing workflow and experience. When you look at an Ansel field it is going to look awfully familiar to you. That's because it builds on the basic styles of the ExpressionEngine Grid field. It's a metaphor your users should already understand. Each row in an Ansel field is an image. If a row is present in the field, an image will be required for that row. If you have allowed more than one image in a field, images can be reordered by drag and drop.
