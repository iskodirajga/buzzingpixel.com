    text: Mandrill Mailer takes the pain out of generating an email from a form on your ExpressionEngine website. Just a few template tags and you’re all set. And as you might have guessed, Mandrill Mailer makes no assumptions about your form. You control the markup, the tags, which fields are required, and which are not. And yes, Mandrill Mailer will send an ajax response so you can take over your form submissions with JavaScript.
