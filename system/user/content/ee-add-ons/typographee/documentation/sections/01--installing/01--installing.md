2. Copy `system/user/addons/typographee` to your ExpressionEngine instance directory (if you are updating, overwrite the `typographee` directory in this location).
3. Navigate to the Add-On Manager and locate Typographee in the third party section then click install (or update) for the Typographee item in the list

Thatâ€™s it. Typographee is now ready for you to begin using.
