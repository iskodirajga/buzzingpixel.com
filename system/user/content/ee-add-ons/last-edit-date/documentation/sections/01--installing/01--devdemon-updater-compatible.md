Last Edit Date is fully compatible with [DevDemon Updater](http://www.devdemon.com/expressionengine-addons/updater) and that is the simplest way to install or update Last Edit Date.

To install for the first time or update to the latest version, simply drop the Last Edit Date zip file on the DevDemon Update drag and drop area, and then click “Start Action Queue”. That’s it. Last Edit Date is now installed and you can begin using it right away.
