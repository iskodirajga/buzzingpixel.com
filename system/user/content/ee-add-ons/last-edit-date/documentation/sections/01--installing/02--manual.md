---

Installing or updating manually (without DevDemon Updater) is also a fairly simple process.

1. Unzip the Last Edit Date zip file you downloaded from GitHub.
2. Copy `system/expressionengine/third_party/last_edit_date` to your third party system directory (if you are updating, overwrite the `last_edit_date` directory in this location.

Thatâ€™s it. Last Edit Date is now ready for you to begin using.
