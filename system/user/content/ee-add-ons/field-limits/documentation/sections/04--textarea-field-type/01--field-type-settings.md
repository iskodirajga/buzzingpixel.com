<div class="centered">

</div>

### Field Rows

Set how tall by rows this field should be.

### Max Length

The Max Length setting limits the number of characters that can be typed into the input field. This is enforced when creating/editing an entry with both JavaScript using a counter to let the user know how many characters are used and how many are left, and a maxlength setting on the input.

### Field Formatting

Chose the type of formatting you want when this field is output using the template tag. Available options are:

- None
- All
- XHTML
- Auto <br/>
- Lite
