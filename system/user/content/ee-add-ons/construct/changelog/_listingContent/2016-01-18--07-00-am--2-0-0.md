Version: 2.0.0

Construct 2.0.0 is a major re-write for ExpressionEngine 3. It will not work at all with ExpressionEngine 2. However, the ExpressionEngine 2 version will remain in the downloadable zip file for a few versions so that if you need to use Construct with ExpresisonEngine 2 you can do that. Construct 1.x will remain feature frozen even if Construct 2.x advances.

## Breaking

- Construct 2.0.0 is not compatible at all with ExpressionEngine 2.x

## New

- Compatibility with ExpressionEngine 3
- Construct control panel adopts the native look and feel of the ExpressionEngine 3 control panel.
- Added the ability to re-order template preferences
- Added options for associating listing channels with a Template Preference
- Added options for marking a template as capable of listing entries
- Added options for marking a template as capable for listing categories
- Added ability to reorder trees
- Added options to nodes for listing channels, pagination, listing entry templates, and category listing templates
- Added ability to expand and collapse Nodes to keep the Nodes page from becoming too cluttered to manage
- Updated drag and drop reordering of Nodes to require user interaction to save rather than auto-saving — this allows changes to the menu items to be queued then saved and updated when the user is ready
- Added the ability to Nodes to have external links
- Updated the setting for disabling routing so that all items not relevant to Nodes are hidden when routing is not enabled — this allows Construct to be used as powerful a menu generation tool only
- Added a new feature that allows routing to be controlled from the EE config file.
- Added new variables on the Construct route: `{construct_route:node_parent_id}`, `{construct_route:node_level}`, `{construct_route:node_external_link}`, `{construct_route:node_output}`, `{construct_route:node_pagination}`, `{construct_route:node_pagination_amount}`, `{construct_route:node_listing_channels}`
- Added `menu_output_only="false"` parameter to the Nodes tag
- Added `node_entry_id_not_empty="true"` parameter to the Nodes tag
- Added new variables to the Nodes tag: `{construct:node_external_link}`, `{construct:node_link}`, `{construct:node_routing}`, `{construct:node_pagination}`, `{construct:node_pagination_amount}`, `{construct:node_listing_channels}`, `{construct:node_output}`, `{construct:level_index}`, `{construct:index}`, `{construct:count}`, `{construct:total_results}`

## Deprecated

- The Entry IDs Tag Pair has been deprecated and will be removed in the next major version of Construct. Please use the `{exp:construct:nodes}` tag.
