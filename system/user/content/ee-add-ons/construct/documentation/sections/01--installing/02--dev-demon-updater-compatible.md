Construct is fully compatible with [DevDemon Updater](http://www.devdemon.com/expressionengine-addons/updater) and that is the simplest way to install or update Construct.

To install for the first time or update to the latest version, simply drop the Construct zip file on the DevDemon Updater drag and drop area, and click “Start Action Queue”. That’s it. Construct is now installed and you can begin using it right away.
