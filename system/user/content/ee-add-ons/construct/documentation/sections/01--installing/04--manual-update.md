Updating manually (without DevDemon Updater) is also fairly simple and looks a lot like the process above.

1. Unzip the Construct zip file you downloaded from Devot:ee.
2. Replace the “construct” directory in your third party system directory with the new version in your unzipped file from `system/expressionengine/third_party/construct`
3. Replace the “construct” directory in your third party themes directory with the new version in your unzipped file from `themes/third_party/construct`
4. Now log in to your ExpressionEngine control panel and navigate to “Add-Ons > Modules.”
5. Click on the Run Module Updates button in the upper right-hand corner.

That’s it. Construct is now updated to the latest version.
