If you do not have DevDemon Updater, not to worry, it’s still pretty simple to install.

1. Unzip the Construct zip file you downloaded from Devot:ee.
2. Copy `system/expressionengine/third_party/construct` to your third party system directory.
3. Now copy `themes/third_party/construct` to your third party themes directory.
4. Now log in to your ExpressionEngine control panel and navigate to “Add-Ons > Modules.”
5. Locate “Construct” in the list and click Install.
6. On the following page, make sure the Module “Install” radio button is selected and click “Submit.”

That’s it. Construct is installed.
