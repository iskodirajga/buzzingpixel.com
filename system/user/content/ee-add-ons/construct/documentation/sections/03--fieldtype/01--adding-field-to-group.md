Title: Adding the Field to a Field Group
---

Construct does not automatically add a publish tab or a field to your publish layout. There are two reasons for this:

1. The developer should define the publish layout and Construct does not want to make any assumptions.
2. You might only have one channel/field group that will make use of Construct for pages so having a publish tab and field on every channel layout to be hidden at the creation of every channel does not seem sensible.

Additionally, the fieldtype **is not required** to use Construct. You may prefer to always manage your pages in the Construct Control panel, and that’s fine — in fact, that is my preference.

So, the Construct Fieldtype needs to be added to any field group you want it to be a part of. You add it just like you do any other field.

1. Navigate to the field group you would like to add the Construct fieldtype to
	1. Admin > Channel Administration > Channel Fields
	2. Then click on the field group you would like to add the Construct field to, or create a new field group.
2. Click on Create a New Channel Field
3. In the “Type” drop down, select “Construct”
4. Name the field whatever will make the most sense to your end users.
5. Click Submit and you’re done!
