Title: Using the Fieldtype
---

Using the fieldtype is pretty simple. If you are creating a new entry, and want it to be a node in Construct:

1. Select the tree you would like the page to be in. This is the only field visible to start with, no other selections or options will appear until you choose a tree.
2. Select the template you would like to use. This field will appear as soon as you select a tree.
3. Optional: Click the green plus button to add a parent to the page.
4. Type the slug you would like to use for this page.

Thatâ€™s it. When the entry is submitted, the node will be created in Construct. You can see how simple it is to use the field type. Construct basically walks the user through the process by showing fields as they become relevant.

<div class="content-blocks__note">
<div class="content-blocks__note-title">Note</div>
<p>
When a node is created from a channel entry, menu output is disabled by default. The reason is because if you want to manage menus and where it will appear in the order of the menu, you will do so in the Construct Control Panel. Until the user has had a chance to visit the Construct Control Panel and arrange the placement in the menu, it will not appear in the menu.
