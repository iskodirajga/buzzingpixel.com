Title: Mustash Plugin
---

[Stash](https://github.com/croxton/Stash)/[Mustash](https://github.com/croxton/Stash/wiki/Mustash) is a great way to gain efficiency and statically cache pages on your site. But you’ll probably want to clear those caches when something about Construct changes. [Mustash supports plugins](https://github.com/croxton/Stash/wiki/Mustash-plugins) for that sort of functionality and that’s why the [Construct Mustash Plugin exists](https://github.com/tjdraper/Construct-Mustash-Plugin). [Head on over and grab it](https://github.com/tjdraper/Construct-Mustash-Plugin)!
