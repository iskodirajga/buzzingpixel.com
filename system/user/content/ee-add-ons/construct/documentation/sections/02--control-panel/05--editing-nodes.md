Nodes are edited inline. Simply click on any part of the node you want to edit, type your changes and press the return key (or click anywhere else on the page).

In the case of templates and entries, you’ll be presented with a drop-down menu to make your selection.

And of course with toggles, simple click on them to turn them on and off.

### Organizing and Nesting Nodes

When you initially add a node to a tree, it appears on the top level as the last item. You may have, at this point, noticed the little drag handle on the left of each node and divined its purpose. It does exactly what you think it does, just drag a node anywhere you want it and its location will be saved as soon as you let go of it.

### Deleting a Node

Deleting a node is easy to accomplish, but could have devastating results. As such, when you go to delete a node, you will be presented with a warning dialog asking if you are really sure you want to do this. Do be certain you want to proceed before deleting that node. Once you click proceed, it is gone forever, never to return. That node is cleared from the database, its A.I. removed from the world… poof.

### Visiting a Node’s Page

If you would like to quickly visit a node’s full route/URI, it is easy to do so.

To the right of the node is a little green arrow, which, when clicked, will open the node’s full URI in a new tab allowing you to see the content of that beautiful page you have created.

That’s all there is to it. Simple, easy, flexible page management. The power to create is now yours.
