Template preferences are a method of abstracting the ExpressionEngine template group and template name. If there are no template preferences, you will not be able to select a template for any of your nodes.

In order to set up a template preference, you must give it a name and select an ExpressionEngine template. These must be unique. There is not really any point in selecting an ExpressionEngine template for more than one template preference. For the name, you might use something like “Standard page,” or “Page w/Sidebar” to help properly identify the page type to the user.

Essentially, all you’re doing with the Template Preference name and it’s associated ExpressionEngine template is giving the EE template a friendly and recognizable name.

The third option on a Template Preference is for the channels associated with the template. In general you’ll probably only have one. But there may be cases where more than one channels shares a field group and you want to have the entries of more than one channel available to the template. And channels are optional. If you have a static template for a one off page, you don’t have to select a channel for a particular template.
