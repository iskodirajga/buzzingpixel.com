This is where the bulk of your Control Panel interaction with Construct will happen. From here you can created nested or flat menu and page arrangements that will drag and drop intuitively and efficiently.

When you first install Construct, there will not yet be any trees so you’ll want to add some. You will probably ever only need one or two trees depending on the complexity of your site. Click the “Add New Tree” button to get started.

### Adding and editing trees

Clicking the “Add New Tree” button will present a standard Add Tree/Tree Settings dialog. Here you can give your tree a name, determine what templates from your Template Preferences will be available to this tree, which member groups can access it, and the maximum nesting depth (up to 5 at the present time).

<div class="content-blocks__note">
<div class="content-blocks__note-title">Note</div>
<p>
The same dialog is used if you click on the “Tree Settings” link next to a Tree’s name. The only difference is there will be one extra button/option to delete a tree.
