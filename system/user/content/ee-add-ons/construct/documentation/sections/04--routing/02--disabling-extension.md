Title: Disabling the Extension
---

Because the Module and the Extension are very closely associated, you cannot uninstall just the Extension. However, you can disable the extension. In fact, that’s exactly what the master toggle to enable or disable routing in the Module settings does. If you do not wish to use Construct’s routing functions, disabling the extension is recommended since would save one query. It’s not noticeable overhead, but if you’re not using it, why not, right?
