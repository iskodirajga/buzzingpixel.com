You can even use character limiting on the Text Input and Textarea simple field types to keep your clients from doing something they’re not supposed to. The WYSIWYG field comes in handy for those tricky global spots that need a little bit of text formatting but just isn’t the type of content you can put in a channel entry, and the Checkbox field will let you give your users control over various aspects you have designed into the site. And the Simple Grid can be a powerful tool for repeating text fields.

    heading: Easy Group Management
    text: Collective gives you easy group management with drag and drop ordering to organize your variables into groupings that will make sense to the content editor or end user as well as give access to critical variables only to certain ExpressionEngine user groups. This allows you to divy up the correct permissions among admins, site editors, content managers and more.
