ListingText: Sometimes, you need end-user friendly global variables for your sites, and Collective makes this easy with it’s simple and intuitive interface! Collective is a simple system to store early parsed global variables in five different field types: Text Input, Textarea, WYSIWYG, Checkbox, and Simple Grid. You can even use character limiting on the Text Input and Textarea simple field types to keep your clients from doing something they’re not supposed to.
