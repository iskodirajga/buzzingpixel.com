Title: Usage
---

- Saving templates as files is required and Tempalte Sync will only run when this is enabled in ExpressionEngine.
- Template Sync will run syncing any time you load a control panel page regardless of your environment.
- Template Sync will also run on any load of any page, CP or not, if you have defined an `ENV` constant and it is anything other than `prod`.

What generally happens when template sync runs:

- If a template, template partial, or template variable is in the database, but not present in your template files, it will be deleted from the database.
- For templates (not partials or variables), if the file extension is changed to one of the accepted ExpressionEngine template file types, the template type will be updated in the database.
- If you have a template group without an index template in the file system, an index file will be created with the contents `{redirect="404"}` (index templates exist for all template groups regardless of whether they are in the file system or not). The content of the index template can be changed at any time.
- Template sync will also create a `_spec` directory with files for all of EEâ€™s specialty templates. Any time one of those files goes missing (like you accidentally delete it), it will be recreated since those templates cannot be deleted.
- Any time the content of one of those specialty templates changes on disk, it will be updated in the database.
