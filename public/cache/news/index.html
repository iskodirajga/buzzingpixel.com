It's a fun place to work, we've done some really cool projects, and I have really good friends there. Caddis is where I have done the most growth in my career life. I came on as a mid-level web developer eager to learn and grow. For the past year as I have been a senior developer helping to shape the team, helping developers learn and grow has been nothing short of amazing. The decision to leave the team wasn’t easy because I really believe the team at Caddis is stronger now than it has ever been and I know there are some cool projects in the pipeline and I enjoy working with everyone there.</p><p>And Caddis does cool stuff like the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/franklin-developer-lunch">Franklin Developer Lunch and Learn</a>, which I will continue to attend and support because I believe in what they are doing.</p><p>But the time has come for me to start a new adventure. I’ll be working on web development through BuzzingPixel full time. While I am already booked for a couple months, if you have any cool projects you would like for me to work on, do get in touch! I’d love to start a conversation with you. I specialize in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, custom add-on development for EE and/or Craft, and I do know ExpressionEngine like the back of my own hand.</p><p>Endings are often beginnings. I will miss the day to day with the team at Caddis, but I look forward to what this new adventure holds!</p></div></div><div class="site-inner-content software-index__item software-index__item--even"><div class="container software-index__item-inner"><h2><a href="/news/add-on-test-drive">Add-on Test Drive</a></h2><p>I definitely know how it is to wonder if an add-on for ExpressionEngine would fit the needs I have before I buy it. I’ve often found it frustrating that I have not been able to know if the add-on does what I need before shelling out cash for it. And that is why I am always willing to let anyone test drive one of my commerical add-ons before purchasing.</p><p>Would you like to test drive one of the BuzzingPixel commercial add-ons before you buy it? No problem! I don't want my paid add-ons hanging around for anyone to download, but if you want to try, I’ll be happy to send you a copy. Just <a href="/contact">get in touch with me</a> and tell me which add-on you're interested in and I'll send you a copy to evaluate.</p><p>And if you have any suggestions or feature requests, be sure to get in touch about those as well. I am currently beta testing some additions to Category Construct that I had a request for that were quite easy to add. The answer to a feature request may not always be yes, but some times it makes sense. And I love hearing from customers!</p></div></div><div class="site-inner-content software-index__item software-index__item--odd"><div class="container software-index__item-inner"><h2><a href="/news/category-construct-for-expressionengine-3">Category Construct for ExpressionEngine 3</a></h2><p>Category Construct for ExpressionEngine 3 is here!</p><p>ExpressionEngine 3 obviated the Control Panel functionality of Category Construct, so the drag and drop control panel interface of Category Construct has been removed. The primary reason I wrote it was for the template tags anyway. So that's all Category Construct is about now. The template tags are a powerful way to output categories with any level of nesting on your terms. You are in completely control of the markup and the logic is... logical.</p><p>The price has also been reduced to $15.00 and it's available for you to buy now!</p><p>You can check out the <a href="/ee-add-ons/category-construct/changelog">changelog here</a>.</p></div></div><div class="site-inner-content software-index__item software-index__item--even"><div class="container software-index__item-inner"><h2><a href="/news/expressionengine-3">ExpressionEngine 3</a></h2><p>ExpressionEngine 3 is here and it's great! Lots of new shiny things like a completely redesigned control panel. And for us developers, a lot of new ways of interacting with ExpressionEngine and building add-ons. The changes mean that ExpressionEngine 2 add-ons are not compatible without a little bit of work. But that comes with the territory and all the changes are actually very good things!</p><p>BuzzingPixel add-on prep/conversion for ExpressionEngine 3 is well under way. In fact, some add-ons have already been ported.</p><h2>Already Available</h2><ul><li><a href="/ee-add-ons/typographee/documentation">Typographee</a> (free)</li><li><a href="/ee-add-ons/mandrill-mailer">Mandrill Mailer</a> (free)</li><li><a href="/ee-add-ons/collective">Collective</a> ($18.00/free update for existing users)</li></ul><h2>Currently Underway</h2><ul><li><a href="/ee-add-ons/category-construct">Category Construct</a><br /><strong><a href="/news/category-construct-for-expressionengine-3">UPDATE: Category Construct is now available for ExpressionEngine 3 for $15.00.</a></strong><br />
While ExpressionEngine 3 happily obviated the Control Panel functionality of Category Construct, the primary reason it was written was for the template tags and being able to output infinitely nested categories in a sane and easy to understand manner. Category Construct for ExpressionEngine 3 will be template tags only. It is currently $20.00. Since the Control Panel functionality is coming out for the next version, the price will be reduced by some amount.</li></ul><h2>Planned</h2><ul><li><a href="/ee-add-ons/construct">Construct</a> ($40.00)<br />
This is an important add-on and still very much needed. Conversion will begin very soon but some major work will need to be done. I have plans for new features as well as integration with the new look and feel of the ExpressionEngine control panel. The current version is something I'm proud of, but the next version is going to be even better! I can't give a timeline right now but stay tuned!</li><li><a href="/ee-add-ons/last-edit-date">Last Edit Date</a> (free)<br />
This will be coming for EE 3, but I've run into some things that I'm waiting on feedback from EllisLab on. It will be soon though.</li><li><a href="/ee-add-ons/pillster">Pillster</a> (free)<br />
I believe this is still needed but the hook it relies on is not in the initial release of EE 3. Hooks are something that is in discussion with EllisLab and developers. I expect this add-on to return in some form as soon as I can.</li></ul><h2>Beta</h2><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/tjdraper/template-sync/tree/develop">TemplateSync</a> (free)<br />
This is an add-on I've wanted to write for a while, so I wrote it and recently re-wrote it for ExpressionEngine 3. It has some things very specific to EE 3. It is currently in beta because I do not have any sites in production with EE 3 to do real world work with yet. But when it does go 1.0 it will remain free.</li></ul><p>I'm excited about ExpressionEngine 3 and writing for it has already brought me much joy. I can't wait to get all my add-ons updated for it and see what else is possible with the new tools and features EllisLab has given us!</p></div></div></div><footer class="site-footer" role="contentinfo"><div class="container site-footer__container"><a href="/" rel="home" class="site-footer__logo-link"><img src="/assets/img/header/logo.png" class="site-footer__logo-img"></a><div class="site-footer__info"><nav class="site-footer__nav"><ul><li class="site-footer__navigation-list-item"><a href="/" class="site-footer__navigation-link">home</a></li><li class="site-footer__navigation-list-item"><a href="/news" class="site-footer__navigation-link">news</a></li><li class="site-footer__navigation-list-item"><a href="/ee-add-ons" class="site-footer__navigation-link">ee add-ons</a></li><li class="site-footer__navigation-list-item"><a href="/contact" class="site-footer__navigation-link">contact</a></li></ul></nav><small class="site-footer__copyright">&copy; 2016 BuzzingPixel, LLC</small></div></div></footer></div></div><script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/2.1.4/jquery.min.js"></script><script>window.jQuery || document.write('<script src="/assets/js/lib/jQuery-2.1.4.min.js">\x3C/script>')</script><script src="/assets/js/script.min.js"></script></body></html>
